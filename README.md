# Biventricular (RVLV) fitting codes

This code performs patient-specific biventricular mesh customization. 

The process takes place in 2 steps:
1. correction of breath-hold misregistration between short-axis slices, and 
2. deformation of the subdivided template mesh to fit the manual contours while pre-serving the topology of the mesh.
